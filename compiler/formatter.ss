  print-Lparser (hereafter referred to as "the formatter") is a pretty printer
  for Compact-language programs.  It prints the Compact program represented by
  a specified Lparser program, breaking it into multiple, properly indented lines
  where appropriate.  Comments appearing in the original source program are properly
  inserted into the formatted program.  Since comments are not directly represented
  in an Lparser program, the comments are obtained from a specified token stream
  and correlated with Lparser program points by source locations.

  The formatter operates in three phases:

  1. During the first phase, it scans the input token stream and builds up three
     tables each mapping source locations (src) to comments (cmt).  The tables differ
     by type of comment:

       up: cmt belongs to the form starting at src on a line above src

       left: cmt belongs to the form starting at src to the left of src on the same line.

       right: cmt belongs to the form ending at src to the right of src on the same line

     The formatter does not recognize any comments in the input token stream as
     "down" comments (belonging to a form ending at src on a line below src).
     Instead, it assumes these modify some form further down (even if that is the
     "eof" token).  Similarly, it treats as "right" comments only those that are
     not followed on the same line by some other form.

     The formatter also creates a fourth table containing all of the comments; this
     table is used used only for a diagnostic check that no comments are dropped.

  2. During the second phase, the formatter converts the Lparser program into
     a simple tree structure in which subtrees represent nesting and leaves
     represent either text to be printed or formatting directives.  The formatting
     directives indicate where spaces must appear, where new lines must be started,
     where new lines may be started if necessary, and the amount by which the
     text on a new line should be indented.

     Each element of the tree structure created during this phase is referred to as a "Q".
     "Q" doesn't stand for anything; it's just a short, arbitrary name used to identify
     the elements of the tree.

     A Q is one of the following:

       Qstring:  a record encapsulating a string representing an atomic bit of text to be printed
       Qconcat:  a record encapsulating a sequence of Qs; used for grouping and representing nesting of forms
       fixnum:   used to indicate optional newlines, spacing, and indentation
       nl:       a unique object used to indicate a required newline (not additive)
       nl2:      a unique object used to indicate a required double newline/blank line (not additive)
       nl!:      a unique object used to indicate a required newline (additive)
       nbsp:     a unique object used to represent a space

     A fixnum, nl, nl!, or nbsp should not occur outside of Qconcat

     Every Q has a size:

       Qstring:      essentially, the encapsulated string's length (but see below)
       Qconcat:      essentially, the sum of the sizes of its consituents (but see below)
       fixnum >= 0:  1
       fixnum < 0:   0
       nl, nl2, nl!: 0
       nbsp:         1

     Because of nl, nl2, nl!, and multiline strings (which can arise from source-language
     string constants with embedded newlines), the actual size computation is as
     follows. The actual size of a Qstring is the length of the first line (not
     including the newline) in the text represented by the encapsulated string.
     The actual size of a Qconcat is the maximum length of the lines represented
     by encapsulated sequence of Qs, taking into account nl, nl2, nl!, and multiline
     strings.

     This phase is the most involved because it has to process each kind of Lparser
     input form and token, create Qconcats for nesting grouping and nesting,
     add formatting directives, and insert comments.

     To obviate certain special cases in the numerous places where Qconcats are
     created, the Qconcat record constructor automatically discards empty Qstrings
     and Qconcats along with any fixnum or nbsp directives that precede them.
     Additionaly support for obviating special cases is built into the Q printer
     described below.

  3. During the third phase, the formatter uses a Q printer to render the program from
     the "Q" tree structure, breaking the resulting text into lines where directed
     or necessary to stay within a target line length and indenting new lines
     as directed.

     The Q printer, in essence, handles each kind of Q as follows:

       Qstring: print the contents of the encapsulated string
       Qconcat: recursively print the encapsulated sequence of Qs
       nl:      start a new line if not already at the start of a line
       nl2:     start a new line if not already at the start of a line;
                then another if not after an empty line
       nl!:     start a new line
       nbsp:    print a space, except at the beginning of a line
       fixnum:  possibly start a new line and indent, or possibly print a space

     In more detail, the Q printer maintains a set of state variables:

       q*:        a sequence of Qs to be printed
       col:       the current column
       reset-col: the current column at the start of the current Qconcat
       break?:    should optional new lines be exercised?
       nl?:       either #f indicating not at the start of a line, or
                  n >= 0 representing the number of new lines pending

     The initial values of these variables are:

       q* = (list Q), where Q is the Q for the entire program
       col = 0
       reset-col = 0
       break?: #f
       nl?: 0

     And the Q printer actually handles the forms as follows:

       Qstring: if nl? is a natural number n, print n newlines and col spaces.
                Regardless, print the contents of the encapsulated string.
                If the string is a multiline string, set nl? to 1.  Otherwise,
                increment col by the Qstring's size, and set nl? to 0.
       Qconcat: recur with new bindings for the state variables:
                  q* = list of encapsulated Qs
                  col = outer col
                  reset-col = outer col
                  break? = col + Qconcat's size > target line length
                  nl? = outer nl?
                after processing all of the encapsulated q*, set the outer
                col and nl? to the inner col? and nl?.
       nl:      set col to reset-col; if nl? is #f, set nl? to 1
       nl2:     set col to reset-col; set nl? to 2
       nl!:     set col to reset-col; set nl? to 1 if nl? is #f, otherwise increment nl?
       nbsp:    if nl? is #f, print a space and increemnt col? by 1
                otherwise set col to reset-col
       fixnum:  if either of nl? or break? is not #f, increment col by the
                fixnum's value (if nonnegative) or by one less than the fixnum's
                absolute value (if negative).  If nl? is #f, set nl? to 1.
                If both nl? and break? are #f and fixnum is nonnegative, print
                a space and increment col by 1.

     Some things are worth pointing out here:
       * the Q printer adds newlines and indentation only when it sees a Qstring
       * multiple consecutive nl and nl2? directives are not additive; this eliminates the
         need for some special casing when creating Qconcats (nl! directives are
         additive)
       * The nonnegative fixnum value n and the negative fixnum value -n-1 both
         force a new line when break? is #t and n spaces of indentation when either
         nl? or break? is true, but the negative value does not cause a space to
         be printed otherwise.  For example, -3 and 2 behave the same except only
         causes a space to be added when the line isn't broken.
